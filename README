1. INTRODUCTION
This is a simple general purpose HTTP server written in C. At the moment, all it
can do is serve files, or provide a 404 if the requested file cannot be found.
This file serves as the documentation for the project, including explanations of
concepts and protocols when I found them useful or necessary.

2. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS


3. THE HTTP PROTOCOL
